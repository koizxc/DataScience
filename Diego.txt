Importance and benefits: 
Data science has a lot of benefits and implications in the medical field. The following are the most common implications of this technology:
•	Facilitates drug development: Medication development takes time and extensive research.
	However, medical data science can cut down on both time and effort. Machine learning 
	algorithms can determine if a drug will have the intended effect on the human body by
	using case study reports, lab test results, previous medical data, and the effects of 
	the drugs in clinical trials.  
•	Reduced failure in treatment: The ability to make precise predictions and prescriptions 
	is perhaps the most crucial application of data science in healthcare for reducing 
	treatment-related errors. Since the data scientists gather a sizable amount of 
	information about the patient's medical history, the stored information can be used to
	recognize illness symptoms and make a precise diagnosis. Mortality rates have significantly 
	decreased since treatment options may now be tailored and care is given with better 
	knowledge.  
•	Enhanced Diagnosis and Treatment: The analysis of enormous volumes of medical data, such
	as patient records, genetic data, and clinical trial data, is made possible by data 
	science. Patterns and insights can be retrieved using data mining and machine learning
	approaches, resulting in more precise diagnoses and individualized treatment programs.
•	Patient Monitoring and Remote Healthcare: Data science supports the creation of wearable
	devices and remote healthcare monitoring systems that continuously gather patient data.
	Real-time analysis of this data can support proactive and remote healthcare delivery by
	assisting in the detection of anomalies, monitoring chronic ailments, and providing 
	individualized feedback.
•	Disease monitoring and epidemic Prediction: Data science helps with disease monitoring 
	and early epidemic detection by evaluating data from a variety of sources, including 
	electronic health records, social media, and environmental sensors. Effective public
	health interventions and containment measures are made possible by the timely detection
	of illness patterns and trends.
 
Scope of the topic
•	This study aims to determine the advantages and good effects of Data Science in
	industries, specifically in the field of medicine. It also highlights the potential
	of data science to advance medical knowledge, improve patient care, and drive innovation
	in healthcare practices. This study also describes what is big data and its implications
	is the field of healthcare and the connection of the Hadoop ecosystem in Data Science.
