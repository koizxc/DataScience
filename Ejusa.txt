If that is how we describe a data, then how can we differentiate it from an information? We can say it this way, if data is raw facts, information is a gained knowledge through study, and it is a result of analyzing and interpreting pieces of data. In simple words, information is a processed data, which put facts into a context. 
Data science encompasses the entire data lifecycle, including data collection, data cleaning and preprocessing, data storage and management, exploratory data analysis, modeling, evaluation, and interpretation of results. It relies on a combination of programming skills, statistical knowledge, domain expertise, and critical thinking to extract valuable insights and solve complex problems.
The data science lifecycle involves various roles, tools, and processes, which enables analysts to glean actionable insights. Typically, a data science project undergoes the following stages:
•	Data ingestion: The data collection of both raw structure and unstructured data from all relevant resources using a variety of methods.
•	Data storage and processing: It is the cleaning of data, deduplicating, transforming and combining data. 
•	Data Analysis: Determining the data’s relevance for use.
•	Communicate: Insights are presented as reports and other data visualizations. 
There is an abundance of useful data in the healthcare industry. Every patient, procedure, diagnosis, course of treatment, clinical trial, prescription, and final health outcome yields data points that can be used to enhance future patient care. The term "big data" often refers to a great amount of data, and some of the biggest potential advancements in health can be made using this enormous volume of data. But how exactly are big data applications employed in healthcare, and what are the results? 
What is ‘Big Data’ in healthcare? To discover insights, trends, and patterns, enormous data sets containing both structured and unstructured data are processed as "big data." Big data is typically defined by the three Vs - volume, velocity, and variety - which indicate that it contains a huge volume of data generated quickly and is made up of various data types, like text, photos, graphs, or videos. 



Big data is produced by numerous sources in the healthcare industry and is evaluated to help with decision-making, enhance patient outcomes, and lower healthcare costs, among other things. Personal health records (PHRs), electronic health records (EHRs), electronic medical records (EMRs), and data generated by widely used digital health tools like wearable medical equipment and mobile health apps are some of the most frequent sources of big data in the healthcare industry.  
To add more clarification and information about the nature of Big Data, we will explain it further through providing example. One of the most significant examples for this is the electronic health records (EHRs), which typically include a patient's medical history, demographic data, prescriptions, vaccines, test results, and progress. Today's EHRs enable health care practitioners to quickly access a patient's pertinent medical information and give the best care possible, as opposed to the past when this information was recorded in handwritten files that were prone to loss, difficult to distribute, and occasionally illegible.

V. Literature reviews and supporting information supporting the group position:
There are a lot of existing studies and literature proving the importance and good impact of Data Science in medical field, one of those is the study conducted by Smith, J.,Johnson,L.,Brown,L., and company. It is entitled: "Data Science in Healthcare: Applications, Challenges, and Future Directions" and it was published in Journal of Healthcare Informatics, year 2021. 
Their study examines the applications, challenges, and future directions of data science in the healthcare domain. It explores how data science techniques, including machine learning, data mining, and natural language processing, are being used to analyze large healthcare datasets and generate valuable insights. It also discusses the challenges associated with data privacy, security, interoperability, and ethical considerations in healthcare data science. The research findings highlight the significant impact of data science in healthcare. Applications of data science techniques have led to improved disease detection and diagnosis accuracy, optimized treatment planning, and enhanced public health interventions. It concludes that data science has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by enabling evidence-based decision-making, personalized medicine, and proactive healthcare interventions.

Before summarizing this topic, let us determine the status of Data Science in the Philippines. Is it as enhanced and advanced as the other country? Or it is still in progress of development? With a predicted yearly GDP growth of over 6% until 2021, exceeding the region's average GDP growth of 5.3%, the Philippines is one of Southeast Asia's economies that is expanding the quickest. However, the data boom is quickly altering the nature of international commerce. Business practices are being disrupted by more creative approaches, like sentiment analysis and targeted marketing. Businesses from all over the world have already demonstrated that a more thorough integration and implementation of data analytics results in increased business value. 


Data Science Status in the Philippines
How are Philippine businesses adjusting to the data revolution? A culture of data drivenness is being fostered throughout more firms as they gradually realize that data is evolving from being merely supporting information to becoming a strategic asset. The goal of a data-driven Philippines is easily attainable through the development of a clear data use strategy, financial investment in analytics technologies, and workforce upskilling in data analytics. 
The 2020 PwC Data Analytics Assessment and Readiness Survey, "Making the Big Leap: Are We Ready for Data Analytics?" seeks to learn more about the condition of data analytics in the Philippines right now. Additionally, it aims to identify the elements that influence data-drivenness and the readiness of corporate organizations to integrate data analytics into their operations. Only two out of every five businesses are highly data-driven, according to the findings, with the remaining three being only somewhat or rarely data-driven. 
It concludes that three out of every five Philippine organizations already have data analytics teams, and the majority are either already integrating data analytics into their everyday operations or aim to do so and it clearly shows and proves that Philippines is now in progress of developing and enhancing the field of Data Science and if this will continue it the long run, Philippine companies and institutions can make a big leap and build a lasting, valuable, and innovative change. 



VII. Conclusion and Recommendations
	In conclusion, this study defines and determines the importance and good impact of Data Science in the field of healthcare. It greatly contributes to the enhancement and convenience of providing healthcare to patients as well as it helps the employees to easily disseminate needed information and produce a quality service. Based on the research we conducted, it proves that Data Science is one of the most impactful technologies because through this, we can produce a more reliable and efficient information from structure and unstructured data by combining scientific methods and algorithms. This technology is helpful in many aspects of healthcare from the drug discovery up to the monitoring and tracking patient’s health. 
	For the recommendations, our group wants to apply data science in optimizing the design and execution of clinical trials. This includes patient recruitment, eligibility criteria determination, and outcome prediction, leading to more efficient and successful trials. We also want to give more focus on the healthcare fraud detection in which data science will be used in identifying fraudulent activities in healthcare billing, insurance claims, and prescription patterns. It that way, we can prevent financial losses and improve the integrity of healthcare systems and medical field.
